## Getting Started

This project uses Docker Compose for easy setup and development.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine) installed and running.

### Running with Docker Compose

1.  **Build and start the services:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project (where `docker-compose.yml` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will:
    *   Build the Docker images for the backend and frontend.
    *   Start the PostgreSQL database, backend, and frontend services.

2.  **Run Django Migrations (first time setup):**
    Once the services are up, you need to run Django migrations to set up the database schema. Open a new terminal in the project root and execute:
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
    ```
    This command runs the `migrate` command inside the `backend` container.

3.  **Access the applications:**
    *   **Frontend:** http://localhost:3000
    *   **Backend API:** http://localhost:8000
